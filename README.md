# Data science blog finder

This application aims to find the latest data science blogs across the internet in order to make it easier for data scientists across the world to stay up to date with the latest best practices and news in data science.

It extracts the latest blogs from [some of the best sources of data science blogs](https://github.com/rushter/data-science-blogs), and presents them to the user through a simple web interface.

Initially, the blogs will be presented to the user by latest publication date. In further implementations we aim to further sort these blogs by category, author, and source in order to make it easier for users to find what they are looking for.
